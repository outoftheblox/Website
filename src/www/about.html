            <h1>OutOfTheBlox</h1>
            <summary>Open source IoT hardware, software and services.</summary>
            <p>Out of the Blox provides open source designs for IoT devices and services. Adhering to the latest security standards but still easy to setup.</p>

            <h1>OpenSource</h1>
            <p>We believe that open source programmers, designers and creators develop together the most innovative and high-quality tools, which surpass proprietary ones on many levels. All our designs for out of the blox are open source. All the source code is distributed under a permissive attribution license and all the designs and documentation is distributed under the Creative Commons license.</p>

            <h1>Secure</h1>
            <p>Security should not be an afterthought. IoT devices should only connect over secure channels, adhering to the latest encryption standards. By incorporating the latest security standards and best practices into theOut of the Blox framework all IoT devices based upon this framework are inherently secure. Setting up security should be easy even on small IoT devices that have limited resources and specifically limited ram space and CPU cycles. The Out of the Blox framework makes sure that setting up devices is as easy as it can be without compromising on security.</p>
            <p>Many IoT devices in the world currently do not implement security or have weak implementations that are easy to hack. Privacy might not always seem that important when you are transmitting simple sensor values -like the temperature- over the network, but often those simple values are accompanied with credentials to access a database or an API. When these credentials are send as plain text anybody might be able to read those credentials and gain access to the database or API. These kind of implementation mistakes often cause a huge security breach.</p>

            <h1>Easy to setup</h1>
            <p>OutOfTheBlox provides easy to set up, secure internet of things frameworks and applications. Many frameworks are not written with security back in mind and often IoT devices communicate with each other and with servers over insecure channeks, which exposes risks with regard to privacy, control over IoT devices and exposure of user credentials. Often security is left out or build in as an aftertought since setting up security seems hard, we at OutOfTheBlox find that implementing secure devices should be as easy.</p>

            <h1>Services</h1>
            <p>Our IoT devices are connectable with services running on machines in the cloud or locally on cheap, energy efficient ARM SoC devices like the OrangePi and the NanoPi. If you do not want the hassle of setting up and maintaining a server you can get an account on outoftheblox.com.</p>
